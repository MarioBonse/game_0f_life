I run an experiment(stages_time) in order to understand the timing of each step.
(!for 30 files!)
On my laptop: 
read: 572 ms
GaussianBlur: 062ms
Sobel: 290ms
write: 316ms
total: 1.1s


ON THE SERVER 
read took: 2.2s
Gaussian filter took: 0.370s
Sobel filter took: 1.12
write took: 1.3s


Approaches
I figured out two possible approaches: 
    1: use a pipeline. If we do so we have to use more than one process for the read stage 
        because is the slower one, it takes half of the time. 
        In only one iteration (thus 30 images) 
        
    2: Use a farm or a paralel for. Since one stage of the pipeline takes half of the time could be 
    smart just to use a farm or a parallel for(since we don't need a drain).

Resuts:
    I decided to use a farm implemented with a parallel for. I used openmp parallel for with 
    schedule (dynamic, 1). In order to be able to acheave the maximum degree of parallelization 
    I did 9 iterations (so we read,filter write 30*9 files = 270)

sequential time: 64.110 ms = 64s
